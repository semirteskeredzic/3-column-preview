## My process

Before starting to code I've created an empty git repository and initialized a git repository inside my project folder, then I set the git remote to the newly created repository.
After that I reviewed design and wrote down HTML structure of elements along with the class names using double and single dash notation. I've created a new preparation branch and went on implementing HTML structure along with global imports of fonts and stylesheets. I've pushed the code and merged it to main branch.
After that all development was done within a development branch where I went from mobile view and populated all HTML elements and styled them using CSS. I've done mobile view first and then used media query to style it on bigger viewports.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
